The goal of rrr.workshop is to download learning materials for
Reproducible Research in R, as well as to install any required packages.
rrr.workshop also allows you to open a given module in RStudio Cloud.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of rrr.workshop with:

``` r
# requires the development version of pak
install.packages("pak", repos = "https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/dev/")
pak::pak("emptyfield-ds/rrr.workshop")
```

## Installing modules

`use_module()` will install the materials for a given module on your
computer. Then, it will open a new RStudio Project containing the files
youâ€™ll need.

``` r
rrr.workshop::use_module("module_name")
```

By default, this package downloads the materials to a conspicuous place
like your Desktop. You can also tell `use_module()` exactly where to put
the materials with `destdir`:

``` r
rrr.workshop::use_module("module_name", destdir = "a/path/on/your/computer")
```

## Opening modules in RStudio Cloud

`browse_cloud()` opens a module in RStudio Cloud, where the materials
and all necessary tooling will be pre-installed. This requires an
RStudio Cloud account.

``` r
rrr.workshop::browse_cloud("module_name")
```
